#Project Features

This is a story project. Everyone writes a sentence into one story. We copy the story into the C++ helloworld program. 

##Create Variables
* Replace all the nouns with a string
* Ask the user to enter the nouns
* Substitute the user answer into the story

##Choose your own adventure
* Ask the user what choice they want next in the story 
* Tell the user how that choice affected their answer

##Topic: How do we get software to make decisions or control the flow 

##Reference
C++ String Library
#include <string>

str.length()
str.size() 
str.find("to") 
str.substr(0,2) 
str.substr(4)
str.insert(0,"HHH")
