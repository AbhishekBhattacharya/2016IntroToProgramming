The files should be called:
euler1.cpp
euler2.cpp

The idea was to introduce functions. By transforming the euler code into generic functions that could solve other non specific goal values.

I have shown them how to use a for() {} loop but it's unclear if they really now it.

====
The other part of the day was to cover what are functions by learning about:
max()
min()
average()
greater()
equals()
lesser()

This can be done by having them enter values via "CIN >>" 

Also, this could be a good place to introduce an integer array but they've only seen it once at this point.
