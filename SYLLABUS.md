#SYLLABUS 2016: Intro C++
Introduction to C++ using Arduino
We will be covering the profesional practices of programming like version control. The course outline and
materials are available in Github. Each student needs to create and account and clone to their own work area
the course materials. That is where all assignements and challenges will be turned in. A majority of the
coding will take place on https://c9.io. Class discussion will be held in https://gitter.io. This allows us
to do code chat. That way I can talk about code properlly formatted and you the student can send me code
examples that are easy to talk about and read. This chat channel will run the entire course.

Spring 2016

Spring Recess Begins: Saturday, March 12
Spring Recess Begins: Sunday, March 20
Semester Start: Jan 20, 2016
Semester End: May 2, 2016
Class Session every  Wed: 1:10pm - 4:30pm

Grading Policy:
Everyone starts at 0. Each week counts towards participation. The class is very hands on, learning, and doing
happen mostly in class. So in person participation is a requirement, and not being there reduces points accrued.

Approximately, every three weeks will be a challenge assignment started in class and take two weeks to resolve.

Weekly, challenge problems will be done in class. As well as, smaller weekly challenges that are take home.

There will be a final project at the end of class that demonstrates the application of the knowledge aquired during the class.

Total Weeks: 16

###Week 5: Introduction to Arduino with C++
* What if the character in the adventure was a machine?
* We will incorporate the knowledge from the previous weeks into learning how
Arduino works.
* Will will be use a local IDE or Code Bender for coding the Arduino
